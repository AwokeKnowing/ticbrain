tic brain
==========

In order to practice using scikit-learn and other machine learning tools, we're trying to use machine learning to learn to play tic tac toe.

So far, we can generate 1 million examples of tic tac toe games where X wins.  We submit that data to a machine learning algorithm, currently gradient boosting classifier, and it's supposed to learn how to play tic tac toe.

The goals of this project are to have a tic tac toe engine where we can plug in various "brains", or models trained to predict a good next move based on a given tic tac toe game board.
